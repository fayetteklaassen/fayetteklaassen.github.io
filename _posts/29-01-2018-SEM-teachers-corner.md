title: Contradictory Conclusions and Time-Intervals
---

Many authors writing about continuous-time modeling have been at pains to point out that the estimates of *cross-lagged* and *autoregressive* effects resulting from discrete-time VAR(1) models can differ greatly depending on the time-interval between observations (e.g. Gollob & Reichardt, 1987; Voelkle & Oud, 2013).  As such, if two researchers are studying the same phenomenon, but one uses an interval of 2 hours between measurements, and the other uses 4 hours, they **may** come to totally different substantive conclusions. However, what the literature has so far failed to address is, in what exact circumstance **will** different time-intervals lead to contradictory conclusions? This is the question Rebecca Kuiper and myself try to tackle in our [latest paper](https://ryanoisin.github.io/files/KuiperRyan 2018_DrawingConclusions_SEM.pdf), recently accepted to the teacher's corner section of *Structural Equation Modeling*.
