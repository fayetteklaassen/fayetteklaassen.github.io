title: Continous Time Modeling - What, Why and How?
---

I am delighted to share a preprint of a book chapter I have written with Rebecca Kuiper and Ellen Hamaker. The aim of this chapter is to provide a broad didactical treatment of the continuous-time (CT) first-order vector autoregressive (VAR(1)) model in the context of psychological research using intensive longitudinal data. We describe the conceptual and practical differences between discrete-time and continous-time approaches, as well as discussing tools like impulse response functions, vector fields and lagged-parameter plots which can be used to interpret CT-VAR(1) models. 

To illustrate CT models we re-analyse a single-subject experience sampling dataset, published by Kossakowski et al. (2017) in the Journal of Open Psychology Data, available [here](https://osf.io/j4fg8/). The analysis was conducted with the *ctsem* package; R code for the analysis is included in the appendix and on my [github page](https://github.com/ryanoisin/continuous_time-ILD-what-why-how/Analysis), where you can also find R code for generating all of the [figures](https://github.com/ryanoisin/continuous_time-ILD-what-why-how/Figure generation). The pre-print is available for download [here](https://ryanoisin.github.io/files/RyanKuiperHamaker_2018_chapter_preprint.pdf)
