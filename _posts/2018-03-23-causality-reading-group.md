In 2016 myself and Ellen Hamaker formed the Causality Reading Group (CRG) in the Department of Methodology and Statistics at Utrecht University. This group meets in principle every two weeks to discuss approaches to and issues within causal inference.

Since Autumn 2017 the format of this meeting is that some reading material is prepared (papers or book chapters) and a short discussion of this material is given by a designated discussant.

So far in 2017/2018 we have looked at directed acyclical graphs, alrogrithms to find DAGs from data, and Lord's paradox.

You can find all of the information about these meetings, including the reading materials, discusscant, and discussant materials, [here](https://ryanoisin.github.io/crg/)
