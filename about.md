I am a PhD candidate in the Methods and Statistics department (faculty of Social Sciences) at Utrecht University. Having graduated from the M&S research masters programme at Utrecht University in 2015, I received an Talent Grant from NWO for the PhD project *Not straightforward: Mediation and networks in continuous time* under the supervision of Ellen Hamaker. 

My project touches on diverse fields such as SEM, time-series analysis, stochastic processes, formal approaches to causal inference and complex systems analysis. I currently organize the **Causality Reading Group** at the M&S department, meeting every fortnight. My teaching duties currently include Theory Construction and Statistical Modeling, a bachelor minor course in factor analysis and SEM, and the Mplus Summer School.
