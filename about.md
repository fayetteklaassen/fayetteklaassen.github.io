In september 2015 I started as a PhD candidate at the Methodology and Statistics Department of Utrecht University. Here you can find an overview of [my research](paper.md) and [presentations](presentations.md).
My research interests are among others the practical considerations of Bayesian informative hypothesis testing, Bayesian updating and synthesis and replication research.
