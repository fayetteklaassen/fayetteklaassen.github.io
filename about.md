Fayette graduated cum laude from the research master program Methodology and Statistics for the Social, Behavioral and Biomedical Sciences, at Utrecht University in 2015. In her master thesis she investigated the required sample sizes for informative hypothesis testing by means of a Bayes factor.

She started her PhD under supervision of prof.dr. Herbert Hoijtink and prof.dr. Irene Klugkist in September 2015 at the [[department of Methodology and Statistics]](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences) at Utrecht University, funded by an NWO talent Grant ([[grant nr: 406-12-001]](https://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/research-projects/i/37/10037.html)). In her PhD she continued working on Bayesian informative hypothesis testing and focused on Bayesian updating of evidence and knowledge synthesis over multiple single subject datasets.

During a research visit to prof.dr. Jeff Rouder at University of California, Irvine in 2019, she compared single case analysis and multilevel approaches to assess whether a theory applies to every case in a population. Throughout her PhD she has applied Bayesian methodology in collaboration with various researchers from literary studies, clinical, developmental and social psychology.
