In 2016 myself and Ellen Hamaker formed the **Causality Reading Group** (CRG) in the Department of Methodology and Statistics at Utrecht University. This group meets
in principle every two weeks to discuss approaches to and issues within causal inference. 

Since Autumn 2017 the format of this meeting is that some reading material is prepared (papers or book chapters)
and a short discussion of this material is given by a designated discussant.

Below you can find the topics of these meetings along with discussant summaries since October 2017.
