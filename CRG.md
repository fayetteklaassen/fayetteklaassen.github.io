In 2016 I formed the **Causality Reading Group** (CRG) with my supervisor Ellen Hamaker in the Department of Methodology and Statistics at Utrecht University. This group meets
in principle every two weeks to discuss approaches to and issues within causal inference. 

Since Autumn 2017 the format of this meeting is that some reading material is prepared (papers or book chapters)
and a short discussion of this material is given by a designated discussant.

Below you can find the topics of these meetings along with discussant summaries sine November 2017.
